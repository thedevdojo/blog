All the files in this repo are used as stubs in your application, which means that every file/folder will be moved from this folder into your application.
Anything you put in this `_ignore` folder will not be moved into your application. This could be things like Cover art for the repo, documentation, etc.

The README.md and `name-of-power-up.json` will also be ignored.
